# Parks_Water_Fountains_Geospatial

After joining 2 datasets (geojson & csv), I created a map to visualize the exact location of the water fountains in Nashville parks, using geospatial data.



If you click on the blue "droplet" icons, you will find the location of the fountains within the park.

The black "paw" icons mean that the water fountain is equipped with a dog fountain as well.



To make it easier to navigate, I also added a search box. Type the name of a park, and a red "tree" icon will take you to the park location.
